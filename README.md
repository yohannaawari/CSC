## Explain DOM.

DOM stands for Document Object Model which is created when the browsers creates a Document Object Model of the page constructed in a form of a tree of objects.

The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.
A Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. But it is the same document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same document so it can be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
It defines:

   1. HTML elements as objects
   2. Properties for all HTML elements
   3. Methods for all HTML elements
   4. Events for all HTML elements

   The HTML DOM is an API (Application Programming Interface) for JavaScript:
   
   a.  JavaScript can             add/change/remove HTML     elements
    b. JavaScript can            add/change/remove HTML    attributes
    c. JavaScript can            add/change/remove CSS     styles
    d. JavaScript can react      to HTML events
    e. JavaScript can            add/change/remove HTML    events
